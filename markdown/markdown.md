# Markdown Coding Conventions

### Filename

Markdown filenames should be uppercase, with extension lowercase (ie. `README.md`).


### Project documentation

- `/`
  - `/README.md`
    Describe the project and include any useful information about how to: setup development environment, run tests, deploy
  - `/CHANGES.md`
    Changelog
  - `/CONTRIBUTING.md`
    If the project is public / open-source, explain how to contribute
  - `/docs`
    Any additional documentation should be placed here and linked in `/README.md`
