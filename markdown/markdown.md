# Markdown Coding Conventions

### Filename

Markdown filenames should be uppercase, with extension lowercase (ie. `README.md`).


### Project files

 - `README.md`: describe the project and include any useful information about how to: setup development environment, run tests, deploy
 - `CHANGES.md`: project changelog
 - `CONTRIBUTING.md`: if the project is public / open-source, explain how to contribute
