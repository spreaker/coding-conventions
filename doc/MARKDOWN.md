# Markdown Coding Conventions

### Filename

Markdown filenames should be uppercase, with extension lowercase (ie. `README.md`).


### Project documentation

```
/
├── README.md
├── CHANGES.md
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
└── doc
    └── MORE.md
```

- `README.md`: describe the project and include any useful information about how to: setup development environment, run tests, deploy
- `CHANGES.md`: changelog
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: if the project is public / open-source, explain how to contribute
- `doc`: any additional documentation should be placed here and linked in `README.md`
