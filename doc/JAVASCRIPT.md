# Javascript Coding Conventions


### Linter

Install the base rules:

```shell
npm install --save-dev eslint-config-spreaker
```

Copy `.eslintrc` from [spreaker/coding-conventions](https://github.com/spreaker/coding-conventions/tree/master/js/.eslintrc) to your project and override / append rules based upon your project. Do you best to keep rules override as few as possible.
